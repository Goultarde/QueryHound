# QueryHound (beta)
## Summary

QueryHound is a Python executable that allows you to create custom queries in JSON format for BloodHound.  
It was created for Exegol ([https://github.com/ThePorgs/Exegol](https://github.com/ThePorgs/Exegol)), so it can be placed in `/home/<user>/.exegol/my-resources/setup/bloodhound/customqueries_merge` and directly generate compatible JSON files.  
For more personal use, consult the help with the `-h` option.

### Improvements

* Create a more graphical interface

---

To use it, just type `python3 bloodhound_query.py`. 
This will ask you for everything that is needed to create your JSON file.
